# Rent Prices Across The United States

An interactive visualization system designed to help non-experts learn about the differences in housing and rent pricing trends across the various counties of the United States.

## Running Locally

Next, clone this repository to download:

```bash
git clone -b live git@github.com:UMBC-CMSC636-Team6/UMBC-CMSC636-Team6
```

The "live" branch is the current live verson of our repository.

## Running Online
